                            An NFT stands for “Non-fungible token” and is a
                            fancy way of saying it’s a unique, one of a kind
                            digital item that users can buy, own, and trade.
                            Some NFTs main function are to be digital art and
                            look cool, some offer additional utility like
                            exclusive access to websites or participation in an
                            event, think of it like a rare piece of art that can
                            also act as a “members” card.

                        <h3>🚀 Dinos to the Moon 🚀</h3>
                        <p>
                            Time to build the rocket ship on Solana. Crazy Dinos
                            go even crazier and start to breed? A Play-to-Earn
                            Game? A Metaverse...? These are just a few ideas -
                            we will leave it up to the Dino DAO to decide what
                            to pool our resources towards.
